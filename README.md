# MyPal Repo

- Important rules:
 
 1. Always work on develop branch. Main branch will be merged with on milestone features.
 2. For each feature, branch off and create a new branch called feature-(nameoffeature). Use names that are associated with the changes made in that feature.
 3. After finish each feature, first commit and push to github. Then create a pull request and merge the feature branch to the develop branch.

- Additional Notes:
 
 Highly recommend using Github Desktop as most of these commands are replaced with buttons :)
 Make sure to have the following installed: .NET 5, SQL Server, SQL Express (for SQL Server)
